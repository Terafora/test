# Arting Around

We are excited to present this proposal for the development of your online art portfolio website. Our team at PEBCAK is dedicated to creating a visually stunning, user-friendly, and secure platform that will effectively showcase the work of talented independent artists  
provide a platform for independent artists to both showcase and sell their work  
and enable customers to purchase original artworks and prints directly. 
 
Arting Around is a website that aims to showcase independent artists’ work and provide a platform to showcase their work and attract potential buyers whilst also enabling users to not only purchase artwork but to show them new stuff.  
We hope to make art accessible to all by providing not only the opportunity to buy original artworks but also prints or smaller pieces to make art accessible for all enthusiasts regardless of budgets.

## Features

- __The Homepage__

    - The homepage being the central hub for visitors was deisgned specifically to keep users up to date with whats new on the site. It shows latest and featured pieces from artists on the site.
    - There is also a signed in version for members of the site where the page will also show art from artists the users follow (Though the full implementation will need to be later on, for now it's just static.)

- __Gallery__

    - The gallery page is used for searching up pieces of artwork or artists.
    - The search bar at the top is planned to have functionality though without a backend it wont function for the moment.
    - There are also a number of where users can find particular filters they may be intersted in such as seraching by particular styles or price ranges.

- __Signup Page__

    - A signup page has been placed for what it may look like. As there is no backend database this hasn't fully been implementated.

- __Favourites Gallery__

    - The favourites gallery is for users to save their favourite pieces or pieces they are interested in. This can be used á la how a site such as Pinterest uses boards.

- __Artist Portfolio Page__

    - The artist portolio page is where artists will have their profiles on display.
    - The page is has latest and featured pieces sections as well as a biography section and a place to advertise links to their social media accounts.
    - Pieces of art have purchase buttons which have a confirmation modal which then takes users to the checkout page.

- __Checkout Page__

    - This page is used for when users wish to purchase a piece of art through the page.
    - The layout is kept simple for buyers and is currently static as no e-commerce functionality has yet been included.

## Unimplemented Features

- As this is all front-end we haven't put in any functions that would require the use of a database of API. This means that purchases can't be made and signup can't be done either.

- "See more" buttons often won't lead anywhere as it isn't in scope and isn't required for creating an MVP of the site but can allude to what could be added if pitch was successful.
  
- Blog posts don't go anywhere just yet as this was out of scope.


## Testing

As we went through making the site we were careful to ensure that each page remained fully responsive each step of the way, we were also extra careful to make sure that all links lead to where they were intended and that no pages were left with no links to them.

That said we did take steps afterwards to confirm that we had managed to stay ontop of this and manually checked as many links as we possibly could but did not come across any unexpected behaviour in this respect.

### Validator Testing

### Unfixed Bugs

None found in testing thus far.

## Deployment

The deployment for Arting Around was somewhat straight forward and had little of note as we went through using Github pages as this was a static site which didn't require the use of any back-end architecture.

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
